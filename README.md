# Photo Gallery Layout

This project is a **Photo Gallery** built with **HTML** and **CSS Grid**.  
It demonstrates how to structure and style a modern gallery using responsive grid layouts, flexible image arrangements, and simple navigation.

## Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to practice and understand **CSS Grid concepts**.  
Specifically, this project covers:

- Creating a **responsive grid layout** with `grid-template-columns` and `auto-fill`
- Using `minmax()` to make grid items flexible
- Applying **gaps** for spacing between items
- Using `grid-column` and `grid-row` to make specific items span multiple columns/rows
- Combining **Flexbox** (for header & footer) with **Grid** (for the main gallery)


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – page structure  
- **CSS3** – styling and grid-based layout
